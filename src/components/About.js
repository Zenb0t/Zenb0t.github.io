                <p className="text-left px-md-5 px-2">I am a seasoned businessman turned software developer,
                graduating from British Columbia Institute of Technology.
                My primary focus as a software developer is building front
                end web and mobile applications and creating microservices
                based APIs in the backend. The tools for the craft can be
                seen in the stack page since I am always playing with something
                new. Agile is my preferred philosophy and I follow Scrum as my main
                framework.</p>

                <p className="text-left px-md-5 px-2 pb-3">Challenging problems are my greatest motivator, and I believe that
                technology play a big part on how we can effectively make a fairer
                and more equitable world. I have a knack for arts and enjoy doing
                some UX and UI design as well. My ideal role would allow me to use
                my analytical and creative skills to pragmatically build functional
                and beautiful software.</p>
